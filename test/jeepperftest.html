<h3>JEEP Performance Test</h3>
<p>
	This is for demonstration only. As I elaborate in the document, performance test is futile, but just for the sake of completeness I am engaging in this rather forced activity. If you have read the document and understand JEEP, then these numbers must make you feel what I feel. Otherwise, give it a bit of thought and you will soon be feeling it. The point is, there is no escaping feeling what has to be unquestionably felt. It is as though this feeling exists in this world to be felt, and sort of tailor made for software engineers who engage in performance tests attempting to quantify the speed of their code. I have more hope for a physician diagnosing the exact cause of fever.
